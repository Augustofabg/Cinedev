## 📝 About the Project
This project was developed as part of a DevClub challenge, aiming to enhance my skills in React, using Styled Components for styling and React Router for seamless navigation.

The main goal was to create a functional and visually appealing movie catalog, allowing users to explore films, view details, and save their favorites, all while providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
